Abstract - Skin diseases are a public health problem which, in addition to causing physical problems for patients, also damage their mental health. The diagnosis is made through the patient's complaints and the health professional's observation of skin lesions. This can lead to mistakes and misdiagnosis, due to the similarity of the shape of the lesions of some diseases. Therefore, applying deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks can help health professionals during the diagnosis process. This work proposed a convolutional neural network using a pre-trained Inception V3 network, using the data augmentation technique on the Dermnet public database. The model implemented showed an accuracy of 84%, sensitivity of 75.6%, and specificity of 91.9%, concluding that the model presented in this article can be a valid means of supporting the clinical diagnosis of skin diseases.
